Going to be talking about projects the next few weeks. These are some of the image segmentation projects that will be happening:
- Polymer residue detection: Detect polymer residues in paper sample images. 
- Broccoli: Detecting heads of broccoli.
- Cracks: Develop a semantic segmentation system to identify and distinguish the umbra and penumbra region of D-cracking.
- Tar Spots - Develop a small format app that can diagnose, detect and count "tar spots" on corn lear images. Integrate this tool into an app that can be used by farmers to track the spread of the disease.
- Cow Segmentation: Develop an automated computer vision system to track individual cattle and monitor nose-to-nose contact patterns for respitory disease survellience
LandGraph is taking multiple models and having them work together and compete against each other. LandGraph does much better with non-fine-tuned models than a fine-tuned model.

Miriam, PhD student, is talking about LLM projects
- Relationship Classification: Useful for tasks such as information retrieval, knowledge graphs, question graphs, question-answering systems, understanding understanding and summarization of large text
- Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) Extraction and Evaluation: Manual labeling is expansive, data is too large. The solution is use LLMs instead.
- Feedback Generation for Essays: Automated essay scoring systems. Generate feedback using LLMs
- LLM Interpretability and Trust: Methods to understand what information a model uses, why it produces an output, and when it's likely to fail. It's not binary. It depends on task risk, data domain, and controls around use.
- Non-Traditional Active Learning: Training LLMs is resource intensive. Active learning reduces annotation effort by picking the most informative samples. Classic methods are uncertainty, diverstiy, model disagreement, ect.
- Noisy Labels, Weak/Self Supervision: A model that trains itself with no labels. Add label confidence/quality to loss function as new dimention.
- Legal Document Summarization: Summarize legal documents because they are very long. Summarize module, revision and judging module, long term memory store.
- Unsupervised Learning / Clustering: Apply natural language text embeddings to improve interpretability of textual data representations.

## 2/3/2026
- Come up with a uuraf thing to show to Dr. Colbry
- Talk about your project in it
- Send it to Dr. Colbry

## 2/24/2026
- Guest speaker: Dr. Rodriguez
- DRIVE lab - research focus areas
### Project 1: Early identification of HPAI in cows during outbreaks in robotic milking systems
- High pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) is a zoonotic disease
- About 300,000 observations
- We also have infection status of cows during the outbreak
- Data in videos and ~20% already in Excel format using a numbers recognition software
- Taking data from milking cows to see if they are getting sick or are sick. That way they can be seperated from the rest of the cows
### Project 2: Predict ketosis postpartum based on metabolic parameters measure prepartum
- Ketosis is a metabolic disease affecting dairy cows
- Dataset of 120 cows measures 5 times each, with 16 metabolites per time point
- The objective is to predict detosis
