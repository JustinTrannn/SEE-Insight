Going to be talking about projects the next few weeks. These are some of the image segmentation projects that will be happening:
- Polymer residue detection: Detect polymer residues in paper sample images. 
- Broccoli: Detecting heads of broccoli.
- Cracks: Develop a semantic segmentation system to identify and distinguish the umbra and penumbra region of D-cracking.
- Tar Spots - Develop a small format app that can diagnose, detect and count "tar spots" on corn lear images. Integrate this tool into an app that can be used by farmers to track the spread of the disease.
- Cow Segmentation: Develop an automated computer vision system to track individual cattle and monitor nose-to-nose contact patterns for respitory disease survellience
LandGraph is taking multiple models and having them work together and compete against each other. LandGraph does much better with non-fine-tuned models than a fine-tuned model.
